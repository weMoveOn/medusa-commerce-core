This API reference includes Medusa's Store APIs, which are REST APIs exposed by the Medusa backend. They are typically used to create a storefront for your commerce store, such as a webshop or a commerce mobile app.

All endpoints are prefixed with `/store`. So, during development, the endpoints will be available under the path `http://localhost:9000/store`. For production, replace `http://localhost:9000` with your Medusa backend URL.

There are different ways you can send requests to these endpoints, including:

- Using Medusa's [JavaScript Client](https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview)
- Using the [Medusa React](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview) library
- Using cURL

Aside from this API reference, check out the [Commerce Modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) section of the documentation for guides on how to use these APIs in different scenarios.

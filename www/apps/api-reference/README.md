# Medusa API Reference

The Medusa API Reference website is built with Next.js 13. You can learn more about contributing [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/contribution-guidelines).

## Note About OpenAPI Specs

The OpenAPI Specs under the directory `specs` are automatically generated by our OAS CLI tool. So, contributions should be made in the files under `packages/medusa/src/api` instead of directly making changes to the generated spec files.

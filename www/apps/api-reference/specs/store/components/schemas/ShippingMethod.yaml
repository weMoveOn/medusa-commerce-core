title: Shipping Method
description: >-
  A Shipping Method represents a way in which an Order or Return can be shipped.
  Shipping Methods are created from a Shipping Option, but may contain
  additional details that can be necessary for the Fulfillment Provider to
  handle the shipment. If the shipping method is created for a return, it may be
  associated with a claim or a swap that the return is part of.

  summary: Calculate Cart Taxes
  description: >-
    Calculate the taxes for a cart. This is useful if the `automatic_taxes`
    field of the cart's region is set to `false`. If the cart's region uses a
    tax provider other than Medusa's system provider, this may lead to sending
    requests to third-party services.

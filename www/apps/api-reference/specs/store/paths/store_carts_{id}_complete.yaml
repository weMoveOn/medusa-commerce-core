  summary: Complete a Cart
  operationId: PostCartsCartComplete
  description: >
    Complete a cart and place an order or create a swap, based on the cart's
    type. This includes attempting to authorize the cart's payment.

    If authorizing the payment requires more action, the cart will not be
    completed and the order will not be placed or the swap will not be created.


    An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header
    `Idempotency-Key` and added to

    the response. If an error occurs during cart completion or the request is
    interrupted for any reason, the cart completion can be retried by passing
    the idempotency

    key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

        If the payment of the cart was successfully authorized, but requires
        further action from the customer, the response body will contain the
        cart with an updated payment session. Otherwise, if the payment was
        authorized and the cart was successfully completed, the response body
        will contain either the newly created order or swap, depending on what
        the cart was created for.

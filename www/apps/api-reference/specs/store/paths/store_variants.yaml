  summary: Get Product Variants
  description: >
    Retrieves a list of product variants. The product variants can be filtered
    by fields such as `id` or `title`. The product variants can also be
    paginated.


    For accurate and correct pricing of the product variants based on the
    customer's context, it's highly recommended to pass fields such as

    `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.


    Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only variants of products
    available in the specified sales channel.

    You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header
    instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.

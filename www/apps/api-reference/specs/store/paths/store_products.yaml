get:
  operationId: GetProducts
  summary: List Products
  description: >
    Retrieves a list of products. The products can be filtered by fields such as
    `id` or `q`. The products can also be sorted or paginated.

    This API Route can also be used to retrieve a product by its handle.


    For accurate and correct pricing of the products based on the customer's
    context, it's highly recommended to pass fields such as

    `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.


    Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only products available in the
    specified sales channel.

    You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header
    instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.

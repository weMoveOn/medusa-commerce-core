  summary: Get Saved Payment Methods
  description: >-
    Retrieve the logged-in customer's saved payment methods. This API Route only
    works with payment providers created with the deprecated Payment Service
    interface. The payment methods are saved using the Payment Service's
    third-party service, and not on the Medusa backend. So, they're retrieved
    from the third-party service.

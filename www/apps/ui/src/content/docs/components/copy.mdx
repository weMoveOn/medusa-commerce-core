This component is based on the `button` element and supports all props of this element.

<ComponentProps component="copy" />

## Examples

### With custom display

<ComponentExample name="copy-custom-display" />

### As child

Using the `asChild` prop, you can render the `<Copy/>` as it's child. This is useful if you want to render a custom button, to prevent rendering a button inside a button.

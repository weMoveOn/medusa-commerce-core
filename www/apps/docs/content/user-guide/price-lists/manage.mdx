# Manage Price Lists

## Create a Price List

To create a price list:

1. Go to the Pricing page.

This opens the form to create the price list in a new window. The form is split into different steps.

In this step, enter the price list's general information:

1. Under the Type section, choose the type of the price list. It can be either Sale or Override.
2. Under the General section, enter the name and description of the price list.
3. To specify a start date for the price list:
    1. Toggle the "Price list has a start date?" field.
    2. A "Start date" field will show. Choose a start date using it.
4. To specify an expiry or end date for the price list:
    1. Toggle the "Price list has an expiry date?" field.
    2. A "End date" field will show. Choose a start date using it.
5. To limit the price list to specific customer groups:
    1. Toggle the “Customer availability” field.
    2. A table is shown where you can select the customer groups that the price list is applied to.

Once you're done, click the Continue button at the top right.

### Step 2: Choose Products

In this step, choose the products that you want to adjust their pricing using this price list. You can choose a product by ticking the box at the left of its row. You can also search through products using the search box at the top right.

Once you're done, click the Continue button at the top right.

### Step 3: Edit Prices

In this step, you can change the prices of each variant of the products you chose in the second step. To do that:

1. Click on the "Add prices button" at the right side of a product.
2. This will open the bulk editor to edit the prices of the product's variant. Learn more about tips to using the bulk editor in [this guide](../tips/bulk-editor.mdx).
3. For each variant, you can specify a price per currency or region.
4. Once you're done, click on the "Save Prices" button at the top right.
5. Keep repeating the process for all products in the price list.

### Save the Price List

After editing the prices of all products in the price list, you can save the price list by either:

1. Clicking the “Save as Draft” button at the top right button to save the price list without publishing it;
2. Or clicking the “Save and Publish” button to save and publish the price list.

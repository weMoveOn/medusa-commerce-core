# Bulk Editor

In this document, you'll learn about different tips and shortcuts to using the bulk editor.

## Overview

The bulk editor allows you to edit prices or values using a spreadsheet-interface. It simplifies the editing process when working with a large number of data, and provides you with an intuitive user experience.

The bulk editor is used in different areas of the Medusa admin, including the [Edit Product Prices](../products/manage.mdx#edit-product-prices) form or the [Create Price List](../price-lists/manage.mdx#step-3-edit-prices) form.

## Toggle Columns View

As the bulk editor may include a large number of columns, such as the different currencies supported in your store, you can toggle the columns' visibility to focus on a subset of columns.

To do that:

1. Click on the "View" button at the top left.
2. Check or uncheck a column by clicking on it in the dropdown.

## Selecting Cells

You can select multiple cells to apply an action on them. To do that:

1. Click and hold the mouse on a cell
2. Drag the mouse in the direction of the other cells you want to select.
3. Once you're done selecting, release the hold.

## Editing Cells

There are multiple ways you can edit cells in a bulk editor:

1. To edit the value without replacing the existing one, double-click the cell, then enter your new value.
2. To edit the value by replacing the existing one, click on the cell and start typing your new value.
3. To apply a value of a cell to other adjacent cells:
  1. Click on a cell
  2. Hold and Drag the blue dot at the corner of that cell to adjacent cells you want to apply the value to.
  3. Once you're done, release the hold on the blue dot.

# allocUnsafeSlow

[BufferConstructor](../../interfaces/BufferConstructor.mdx).allocUnsafeSlow

`**allocUnsafeSlow**(size): [Buffer](../../variables/Buffer-1.mdx)`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `size` is larger than constants.MAX_LENGTH or smaller than 0, `ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE` is thrown. A zero-length `Buffer` is created if
`size` is 0.

The underlying memory for `Buffer` instances created in this way is \_not\_
\_initialized\_. The contents of the newly created `Buffer` are unknown and \_may contain sensitive data\_. Use `buf.fill(0)` to initialize
such `Buffer` instances with zeroes.

When using `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` to allocate new `Buffer` instances,
allocations under 4 KiB are sliced from a single pre-allocated `Buffer`. This
allows applications to avoid the garbage collection overhead of creating many
individually allocated `Buffer` instances. This approach improves both
performance and memory usage by eliminating the need to track and clean up as
many individual `ArrayBuffer` objects.

However, in the case where a developer may need to retain a small chunk of
memory from a pool for an indeterminate amount of time, it may be appropriate
to create an un-pooled `Buffer` instance using `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()` and
then copying out the relevant bits.

```js
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

// Need to keep around a few small chunks of memory.
const store = [];

socket.on('readable', () => {
  let data;
  while (null !== (data = readable.read())) {
    // Allocate for retained data.
    const sb = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(10);

    // Copy the data into the new allocation.
    data.copy(sb, 0, 0, 10);

    store.push(sb);
  }
});
```

A `TypeError` will be thrown if `size` is not a number.

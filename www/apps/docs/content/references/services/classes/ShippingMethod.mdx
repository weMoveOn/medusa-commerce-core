# ShippingMethod

A Shipping Method represents a way in which an Order or Return can be shipped. Shipping Methods are created from a Shipping Option, but may contain additional details that can be necessary for the Fulfillment Provider to handle the shipment. If the shipping method is created for a return, it may be associated with a claim or a swap that the return is part of.

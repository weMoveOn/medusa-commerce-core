# How to Override Price Selection Strategy

In this document, you’ll learn how to override Medusa’s price selection strategy to create a custom pricing strategy.

:::note

If you’re interested in learning what a price selection strategy is and how it works, check out [this documentation](../price-selection-strategy.md) instead.

:::

## 1. Create Class

Create a TypeScript or JavaScript file in `src/strategies` of your Medusa backend project with a class that extends the `AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy` class:

```ts title=src/strategies/price.ts
import { 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy, 
  PriceSelectionContext, 
  PriceSelectionResult,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { 
  TaxServiceRate,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/tax-service"

export default class MyStrategy extends 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy {

  async calculateVariantPrice(
    data: { 
      variantId: string; 
      taxRates: TaxServiceRate[]; 
      quantity?: number 
    }[], 
    context: PriceSelectionContext
  ): Promise<Map<string, PriceSelectionResult>> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
}
```

### Resolve Resources

You can resolve resources like services or repositories using [dependency injection](../../../development/fundamentals/dependency-injection.md).

For example:

```ts title=src/strategies/price.ts
import { 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy, 
  CustomerService, 
  PriceSelectionContext, 
  PriceSelectionResult,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { 
  TaxServiceRate,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/tax-service"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  customerService: CustomerService
}

export default class MyStrategy extends 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy {
  
  protected customerService_: CustomerService

  constructor(container: InjectedDependencies) {
    super(container)
    this.customerService_ = container.customerService
  }

  // ...
}
```

## 2. Implement calculateVariantPrice

In this method, you can implement your price selection strategy.

### Parameters

You can learn more about optional properties and the meaning behind every property [here](../price-selection-strategy.md#calculatevariantprice-method).

## 3. Run Build Command

In your terminal, run the build command to transpile the files in the `src` directory into the `dist` directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

---

## Test it Out

Run your backend to test it out:

```bash npm2yarn
npx medusa develop
```

Then, try out your strategy using any of the [Products](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#products) or [Carts](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts) API Routes which include retrieving product variants and line items respectively. You should then see the prices in the response based on your implemented strategy.

# v1.9.0

Version 1.9.0 of the Redis Cache Module introduces minor breaking changes.

## Overview

This release contains breaking change to the method `set`. Passing a `ttl` value of 0 when using the method will skip the attempt to set the cache entry entirely.

## How to Update

Run the following command in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/cache-redis@1.9.0
```

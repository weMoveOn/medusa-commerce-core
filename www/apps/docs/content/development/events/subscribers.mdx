# Subscribers

In this document, you'll learn what Subscribers are in Medusa.

## What are Subscribers

Subscribers register handlers for an events and allows you to perform an action when that event occurs. For example, if you want to send your customer an email when they place an order, then you can listen to the `order.placed` event and send the email when the event is emitted.

Natively in Medusa there are subscribers to handle different events. However, you can also create your own custom subscribers.

Custom subscribers are TypeScript or JavaScript files in your project's `src/subscribers` directory. Subscriber files must default export a handler function and export a configuration object.

Whenever an event is emitted, the subscriberâ€™s handler function is executed. The handler function receives as a parameter an object that includes the data payload, among other parameters. For example, if an order is placed, the `order.placed` event is emitted and all the handlers receive the order ID in the `data` object.

### Example Use Cases

Subscribers are useful in many use cases, including:

- Send a confirmation email to the customer when they place an order by subscribing to the `order.placed` event.
- Automatically assign new customers to a customer group by subscribing to the `customer.created`.
- Handle custom events that you emit

## Custom Development

Developers can create custom subscribers in the Medusa backend, a plugin, or in a module.

<DocCard item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/development/events/create-subscriber',
    label: 'Create a Subscriber',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],

    }
  }}
/>

# Manage Shipping Options in a Region

In this document, you’ll learn how to manage a region’s shipping options in your Medusa Admin.

## Types of Shipping Options

There are two types of shipping options in a region:

1. Shipping Options that are used when a customer places an order or when an admin creates a draft order.
2. Return Shipping Options that are used when a customer requests a return or exchange for their order, or when an admin registers an exchange, a claim, or a return for an order.

A shipping option can’t be used for both cases. In a region, you can create an unlimited amount of shipping options and return shipping options.

### Add Shipping Option to a Region

To add a shipping option:

1. Go to Settings → Regions.
2. Select the shipping option's region.
3. Scroll down to the Shipping Options section on the right side.
4. Click on the Add Option button.
5. A new window will open with a form with the following fields:
    - **Visible in Store:** Whether or not this option should be available on the website. This is useful if you want to create a shipping option only for use on the Medusa Admin (for example, to create draft orders).
    - **Title (Required):** The name of the shipping option. The customer will see this name on the storefront if the “Show on Website” field is checked.
    - **Price Type (Required):** The type of price. It can be either Flat Rate or Calculated. If you choose Flat Rate, this will show a new field **Price**. If you choose Calculated, it's assumed the calculation of the shipping option is handled using custom logic implemented in the Fulfillment provider.
    - **Price:** This field is only available and required when you set the **Price Type** to Flat Rate. It indicates the price of the shipping option.
    - **Shipping Profile (Required):** The shipping profile this option belongs to.
    - **Fulfillment Method (Required):** the fulfillment provider that will handle fulfilling this shipping option.
    - **Requirements:** You can use this section to specify a condition for when this shipping option should be available during checkout or draft-order creation. The "Min. subtotal" field indicates the minimum cart subtotal required to use this shipping option, and the "Max. subtotal" field indicates the maximum cart subtotal required to use this shipping option. For example, you can fill in the first field “100” to only allow using this shipping option if the cart’s subtotal is at least $100.
    - **Metadata**: This section allows you to add custom data to the shipping option in the form of a key-value pair. This is mostly helpful for technical teams and developers.
6. Once you’re done, click the "Save and close" button.

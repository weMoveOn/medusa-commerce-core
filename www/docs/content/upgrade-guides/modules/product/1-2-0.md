## Actions Required

### Change usage of Product Module

If you've applied the category filter to the `list` or `listAndCount` methods of the Product Module, you will need to change it as follows:

```ts
// Before
ProductService.list({ 
  category_ids: ["pcat_123", "pcat_456"], 
})
ProductService.listAndCount({ 
  category_ids: ["pcat_123", "pcat_456"], 
})

// Now
ProductService.list({ 
  category_id: ["pcat_123", "pcat_456"], 
})
ProductService.listAndCount({ 
  category_id: ["pcat_123", "pcat_456"], 
})
```
